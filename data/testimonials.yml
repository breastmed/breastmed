  - quote: Justice was really helpful when I needed to advocate for myself and my
      child’s decision to continue breastfeeding past one year. She supported me
      with information and references to feed back to our health visiting team
      about the problems with the advice I had received from them.

  - quote: As a second time mum who  struggled to breastfeed my firstborn due to
      lack of knowledge and confidence, I was determined second time round I was
      going to give it a real go. The first few days/weeks as any new mum knows
      is difficult and breastfeeding (for some) does not come as naturally as
      one would expect! I was starting to feel upset and disappointed that I
      wasn't going to be able to establish breastfeeding this time around
      either. I was so fortunate to have had a supportive friend who put me in
      touch with Justice. Justice not only supported me in my journey but she
      also educated me on the world of breastfeeding which is rather fascinating
      and well pretty awesome for both mother and baby! I would thoroughly
      recommend if you're struggling with your breastfeeding journey to get in
      touch with Justice. I am delighted to say I am still breastfeeding my
      little girl at six months and have no intention of giving it up until she
      is ready. I can genuinely say without Justice's knowledge and caring
      support I would have probably stopped in those early days.

  - quote: I have had support from Justice several times both antenatally and during
      the 8 months I have been breastfeeding my son. Her advice helped me to
      establish exclusive breastfeeding with a small for gestational age
      newborn, and later to continue through mastitis and blocked ducts. She is
      approachable and friendly, with a strong knowledge base. The most
      impressive thing about her support is it is always a step ahead,
      considering how management now could affect feeding in the future. I’m
      sure that this has helped our breastfeeding journey to be relatively
      smooth and enjoyable.

  - quote: I returned to work as an NHS doctor with my baby continuing to nurse
      overnight. My concerns with working night shifts were that I had a history
      of mastitis and blocked ducts and had no real success with a
      pump.  Justice guided and encouraged me through the process of speaking to
      HR and Occupational Health and I was able to negotiate time off nights
      until my baby had weaned.  For us, this was an important part of being
      able to maintain my supply and continue breastfeeding.  Here I am still
      breastfeeding my 21 month old toddler!  It was very difficult to get here
      but I am so glad that I persisted and prioritised my health and baby!

  - quote: I always had my heart set on breastfeeding my baby and just assumed it
      would come naturally once she was born, it therefore came as a huge
      surprise when I realised how much of a challenge it would actually be. In
      the first few weeks I was totally consumed with the stress of trying to
      establish breastfeeding, I was filled with worry that my baby wasn’t
      getting enough food and felt very alone with very little support from
      medical professionals. I felt a sense of grief that I might not be able to
      experience this special bond with my baby and felt I had failed her in
      some way.  My desire to breastfeed was based on lots of things including
      bonding, nutrition, but also has so many positive health benefits that
      last a lifetime. I was almost at the point of giving up when I received
      support from Justice.  Not only did she rapidly respond to my messages at
      any time of the night or day but did so with compassion and kindness which
      instantly gave me belief in myself. Justice came over to my house and
      supported me in achieving my breastfeeding goals and I have never looked
      back, it was simply a lifeline for our journey and 10 months on we are
      still going strong. I honestly belief I would have given up if it hadn’t
      been for the care and support I received.

    quote: "I had some medical challenges that meant I was unlikely to make a full
      milk supply but I still wanted to try breastfeeding.  Justice supported me
      and came up with options that I had no idea existed!  My baby is still
      able to get so much benefit from my milk and I am so grateful we have this
      special relationship.  It's really important in my culture to breastfeed
      until the child is 2, and we are so close to achieving that! I am so glad
      I reached out and got support from an expert.  It would have been so easy
      to just bottle feed from the start and I had some family tell me not to
      worry about breastfeeding, but it makes me sad now to think what we would
      have missed out on.  "
