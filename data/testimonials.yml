      Justice was really helpful when I needed to advocate for myself and my child’s decision to continue breastfeeding past one year. She supported me with information and references to feed back to our health visiting team about the problems with the advice I had received from them.

      As a second time mum who  struggled to breastfeed my firstborn due to lack of knowledge and confidence, I was determined second time round I was going to give it a real go. The first few days/weeks as any new mum knows is difficult and breastfeeding (for some) does not come as naturally as one would expect! I was starting to feel upset and disappointed that I wasn't going to be able to establish breastfeeding this time round either. I was so fortunate to have had a supportive friend who put me in touch with Justice. Justice not only supported me in my journey but she also educated me on the world of breastfeeding which is rather fascinating and well pretty awesome for both mother and baby! I would thoroughly recommend if you're struggling with your breastfeeding journey to get in touch with Justice. I am delighted to say I am still breastfeeding my little girl at six months and have no intention of giving it up until she is ready. I can genuinely say without Justice's knowledge and caring support I would have probably stopped in those early days.

      I have had support from Justice several times during the 8 months I have been breastfeeding my son. Her advice helped me to establish exclusive breastfeeding with a small for gestational age newborn, and later to continue through mastitis and blocked ducts. She is approachable and friendly, with a strong knowledge base. The most impressive thing about her support is it is always a step ahead, considering how management now could affect feeding in the future. I’m sure that this has helped our breastfeeding journey to be relatively smooth and enjoyable.

      I returned to work as an NHS doctor with my baby continuing to nurse overnight. My concerns with working night shifts were that I had a history of mastitis and blocked ducts and had no real success with a pump. My concerns were bounced around occupational health and HR with no one really taking an interest in the issue. Overall, I felt they hadn’t a clue which was baffling, as I was surely not the first woman returning to work whilst breastfeeding.

      Justice guided and encouraged me through the process and I was able to negotiate time off nights until my baby had weaned.  For us, this was an important part of being able to maintain my supply and continue breastfeeding.

      Here I am still breastfeeding my 21 month old toddler! It was very difficult to get here but I am so glad that I persisted and prioritised my health and baby!

      I always had my heart set on breast feeding my baby and just assumed it would come naturally once she was born, it therefore came as a huge surprise when I realised how much of a challenge it would actually be. In the first few weeks I was totally consumed with the stress of trying to establish breastfeeding, I was filled with worry that my baby wasn’t getting enough food and felt very alone with very little support from any medical professionals. I felt a sense of grief that I might not be able to experience this special bond with my baby and felt I had failed her in some way. My desire to breast feed was based on lots of things including bonding with my baby and the strong belief that breast milk is not only a well balanced nutritional source of food for my baby but also has so many positive health benefits that last a lifetime. I was almost at the point of giving up when I received support and help from Justice,  not only did she rapidly respond to my messages at any time of the night or day but did so with compassion and kindness which instantly gave me belief in myself, that I was doing all the right things for my baby. Justice came over to my house during her own time and supported me in achieving my breastfeeding goals and I have never looked back, it was simply a lifeline for our journey and 10 months on we are still going strong. I honestly belief I would have given up if it hadn’t been for the care and support I received.
