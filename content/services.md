      ## Home visit


      A 1:1 consultation gives us the time to explore your medical, birth and breastfeeding history to date, as well as your breastfeeding goals. A home visit allows us to use your own furniture for positioning and attachment which can be repeated after I have left. Babies should be fed responsively, but you may want to offer milk around 2 hours before I arrive so we will be able to talk before they need to feed again. I understand babies are unpredictable however, and the benefit of a home visit is that we can go entirely at your baby's pace. You won't have to worry about your baby crying in the car seat or being late because they needed a nappy change just as you're about to leave.  It is advisable to inform your NHS team of your home visit appointment time. 


      Most families require only 1 home visit and I am available for email support for as long as you need it.


      * Home consultations include a written report within 48 hours which can be shared with your medical team, legal representative or employer.


      ### £300


      ### 1.5 hour appointment, with text support for 2 weeks.

      ## Online consultation


      Most aspects of a lactation consultation can be delivered in a telehealth appointment.   Videos of your baby feeding and weight charts can be sent and reviewed in advance to make the most of the appointment.   This may be more appropriate for situations such as devising a breastfeeding/expressing plan for faltering weight, or return to work, negotiating nursing boundaries with your toddler, or how to maximise family sleep.  Private prescriptions are invoiced separately at a cost of £20 per prescription, plus the medication cost, and are delivered to UK addresses only.  


      Written reports are available within 48 hours and can be shared with relevant professionals.  The report can be shared with medical doctors in your home country to aid prescribing. 


      ### £120, 45 Minute appointment


      ### £65, 30 Minute Follow Up Appointment

      ## Debrief


      Breastfeeding doesn't always go to plan and many mothers are left feeling guilty or with feelings of loss when they haven't breastfed, or haven't breastfed for as long as they wanted. I have a unique perspective from speaking to women in breast clinic in their 50s and 60s who are still trying to come to terms with this sense of failure. Whether it was 20 days or 20 years ago, I am able to help you process what happened and potentially offer some answers to your questions.


      This can also be an important step in your next breastfeeding journey, and provide closure before your next baby arrives. We can come up with an individualised plan to optimise breastfeeding the next time based on your particular challenges. A breastfeeding debrief and understanding can also help you make peace with your own journey so that you are able to fully support a loved one such as a daughter or granddaughter.  


      ### 1 hour virtual appointment


      ### £150

      ## Clinic Consultations


      T﻿hese consultations are available at Spiersbridge Business Park, G46.


      All aspects of the at home consultation are available as well as prescribing, blood tests and therapeutic breast ultrasound.  


      ### £220, 1 hour appointment, with text support for 1 week


      ### £100, 30 Minute Follow Up appointment


      ### £100, 30 minute Therapeutic Breast Ultrasound appointment


      This is a non-invasive targeted treatment for blocked ducts, and mastitis.  Gentle heat pulses and sound waves reduce lymphatic congestion and promote milk flow.  P﻿lease bring your baby or breast pump to these appointments, as treatment works best when you are able to remove milk afterwards.  A series of 3 treatments is recommended, but those who cannot attend return appointments have the option of kinesio breast taping to aid lymphatic drainage.  This usually remains applied for 2-3 days and can be removed at home. 


      ### £200  Low Milk Supply Investigations 30 Minute appointment


      T﻿his appointment includes a breast exam, a full blood panel including pre- and post- feed /milk expression prolactin.  Prescriptions are charged at £20 plus medication costs.  If domperidone is prescribed it is recommended to have follow-up every 3 months to assess dosage, and to have an ECG.
