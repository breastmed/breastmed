      I am a Speciality Breast Doctor and International Board Certified
      Lactation Consultant (IBCLC).

      I had my first baby in 2014 and was struck by how limited breastfeeding knowledge and support was.

      Many of my friends sadly said the same things, that they would get inconsistent and sometimes wrong advice making those early weeks harder than they needed to be.

      This started me on a path of education, voluntarily supporting families as a breastfeeding counsellor and later as a private lactation consultant, alongside my NHS practice.

      I continue to run a community breastfeeding support group in Glasgow, and offer voluntary support.

      I also form part of many committees looking to improve infant and maternal health outcomes.

      My passion is helping mothers and families experience the unique
      connection and health outcomes that come with breastfeeding and human milk
      feeding. 


      As a mum myself, I recognise how important this is to you and your baby.

      I also recognise the need for early skilled support to get your journey off to a good start.

      It can prevent problems or an early end to lactation later on.  I focus on optimising breastfeeding rather than what volume of your milk your baby is getting, and each family's feeding journey will look slightly different.
