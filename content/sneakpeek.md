  S﻿neakPeek Clinical by Gateway Genomics is the only clinically proven early gender DNA test that lets you discover your baby's sex months ahead of ultrasound, so you can prepare for your little one's arrival, and share with family and friends.  Did you know a small fraction of your baby's DNA circulates in the maternal blood stream?  The test uses non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to look for male Y chromosomes from a small sample of your blood.  From just 3ml of blood we can determine whether male Y chromosomes are found, meaning the baby is a boy.  If none are found, your baby is a girl.  SneakPeak is the leading provider of this technology and the most accurate test on the market, trusted by over 1 million mums and medical providers.

      *F﻿requently Asked Questions*


      **W﻿hy Do a Clinical Test?**


      S﻿neakPeek also offer an at-home test you can do yourself.  Currently in the UK, this involves drawing blood through a fingerprick test and squeezing drops out.  Having a venous blood sample in clinic reduces the chance of contamination and improves the accuracy of results.  


      **I﻿'ve previously had a boy, or miscarriage.  Will that skew my results?**  


      C﻿linical studies have shown that foetal DNA clears from the bloodstream within a few hours, to 2 days after birth. 


      **I﻿'m having twins.  Can SneakPeek determine fetal sex for each one?**


      I﻿n the case of identical twins, if male DNA is found, then both babies are boys.  If no male DNA is found, then both babies are girls.  For fraternal twins (or non-identical twins), finding male DNA will confirm at least one baby is a boy, but cannot distinguish if the second is a boy or a girl.  


      **D﻿o hormone disorders such as PCOS affect my results?**


      SneakPeek is a DNA-based test, so hormones do not impact results.


      **D﻿o blood thinners affect my results?**


      S﻿neakPeek looks only for the presence of Y chromosomes and is extremely sensitive and accurate.  No blood thinners or other drugs are known to impact SneakPeek gender results. 


      **A﻿re results guaranteed?**
